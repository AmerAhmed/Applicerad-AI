We start by collecting a dataset of images of fresh and rotten fruits. We will need a number of images, with a roughly equal number of examples of each class (fresh and rotten). We should also make sure that the images are of good quality and resolution, and that they are correctly labeled as fresh or rotten.

Preprocess the images by resizing them to a uniform size and normalizing their pixel values. This will help ensure that the model can more easily learn from the data.

Split the dataset into training and test sets. We should use the training set to train the model, and the test set to evaluate its performance.

We use TensorFlow and Keras to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the images. A CNN is a type of deep learning model that is well-suited for image classification tasks. We will need to specify the structure of the CNN, including the number of layers and the number of filters in each layer.

Train the model on the training set. This will involve feeding the images and their labels into the model and adjusting the model's weights and biases to minimize the error between the predicted labels and the true labels.

Evaluate the model's performance on the test set. This will involve using the model to classify the test images and comparing the predicted labels to the true labels. You can use metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall to measure the model's performance.

If the model's performance is not satisfactory, we can try fine-tuning the model by adjusting its hyperparameters or adding more layers or filters.
